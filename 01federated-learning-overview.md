# Key Ideas in Federated Learning

Federated Learning is a machine learning technique that enables training models on distributed datasets without centralizing the data. Here are the key ideas:

1. **Decentralized Data**: 
   - Data remains on local devices or servers
   - Preserves privacy and data ownership

2. **Collaborative Learning**:
   - Multiple parties contribute to training a shared model
   - No need to share raw data

3. **Model Updates**:
   - Local models are trained on local data
   - Only model updates (e.g., gradients) are shared

4. **Aggregation**:
   - A central server aggregates model updates
   - Federated Averaging is a common aggregation method

5. **Privacy Preservation**:
   - Differential privacy can be applied to model updates
   - Secure aggregation protocols protect individual contributions

6. **Communication Efficiency**:
   - Reduces need for data transfer
   - Techniques like model compression and update sparsification are used

7. **Heterogeneity Handling**:
   - Deals with non-IID (non-independent and identically distributed) data
   - Addresses system heterogeneity (varying compute resources)

8. **Applications**:
   - Mobile keyboard prediction
   - Healthcare (collaborative research across institutions)
   - IoT and edge computing

9. **Challenges**:
   - Communication overhead
   - Security against adversarial attacks
   - Balancing model performance and privacy

Federated Learning represents a paradigm shift in machine learning, enabling collaboration while respecting data privacy and ownership.
